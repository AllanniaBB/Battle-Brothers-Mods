mod_better_combat_log_bigger
mod_better_combat_log_small
mod_better_combat_log_vanilla
- Status: Initial update - No known issues, but could do with addiitons (in-game setting to choose starts expanded, size, etc, instead of seperate almost identical versions)
- Last tested: 5/10/2025
- Vanilla: v1.5.1.7
- Legends: TBD (seems to work, but legends touches almost everything and I haven't played it much. Update: Resized log will not apply to legends)

mod_better_hit_information
- Status: Initial update - No known issues, but could do with re-working and expanding. Alternatively, mods like Tactical hit factors exist, so this might be entirely redundant now. 
- Last tested: 5/10/2025
- Vanilla: v1.5.1.7
- Legends: edundant, legends has it's own equivalent (and probably better) implementation.

- Legends: TBD (it seems to work, but legends has it's own extensive UI changes and I haven't played it much).
